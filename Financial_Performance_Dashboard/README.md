This is my Tableau project: Financial Performance Dashboard.

The goal was to visualize financial KPIs like sales, profit, discounts, and COGS across regions and categories.

I built interactive dashboards with filters for region, category, and time period. The visuals include KPI cards, area charts, profit maps, and heatmaps for discount intensity.

Insights revealed that the Technology category performs best in profit, while high discounts reduce overall margins. The dashboard supports strategic business decisions.

This project helped me improve data storytelling using Tableau and enhanced my dashboard design skills.

Thank you for watching.
