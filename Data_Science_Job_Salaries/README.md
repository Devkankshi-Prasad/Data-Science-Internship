Hello, hereâ€™s a summary of my project on Data Science Job Salaries.

This project analyzes salary trends across job titles, company sizes, and locations for data science roles.

Through EDA, I found that senior roles command significantly higher salaries, and large companies offer better compensation. I also observed regional differences in pay scales.

I used regression models to understand salary prediction, and evaluated them using R-squared and MAE.

The analysis helps job seekers understand market trends and helps HR teams benchmark compensation effectively.

Thank you.
